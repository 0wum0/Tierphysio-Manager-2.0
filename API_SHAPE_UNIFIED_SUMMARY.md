# Tierphysio Manager 2.0 - API Shape Unification Complete

## Summary

All API endpoints have been successfully unified to return consistent JSON response shapes.

## Unified Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "items": [...],
        "count": N
    }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
    "ok": false,
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Error description"
}
```

## Changed Files

1. **Created Files:**
   - `/api/_bootstrap.php` - Central bootstrap file with unified helper functions
   - `/api/integrity_json.php` - Integrity check endpoint with unified format
   - `/workspace/verify_api.php` - Verification script for testing all endpoints

2. **Modified API Files:**
   - `/api/patients.php` - Uses bootstrap, unified response format, owner join in list
   - `/api/owners.php` - Uses bootstrap, unified response format, minimal fields in list
   - `/api/appointments.php` - Uses bootstrap, unified response format
   - `/api/treatments.php` - Uses bootstrap, unified response format
   - `/api/invoices.php` - Uses bootstrap, unified response format
   - `/api/notes.php` - Uses bootstrap, unified response format
   - `/api/index.php` - Updated integrity_json response format

3. **Modified Template:**
   - `/templates/pages/patients.twig` - JS compatibility for both old and new response formats

4. **Deleted Files:**
   - `/public/api_patients.php` - Duplicate API file removed

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Shape:** Every endpoint now returns the exact same JSON structure
2. **Central Bootstrap:** All APIs use `/api/_bootstrap.php` for shared functions
3. **Correct Table Names:** All queries use `tp_*` prefix (tp_patients, tp_owners, etc.)
4. **Owner Integration:** Patients list includes owner information with JOIN
5. **Create with Owner:** Patients can be created with new owner in single operation
6. **Minimal Fields:** Owners list returns only essential fields for performance
7. **Backward Compatibility:** Patients page JS handles both old and new formats
8. **No HTML Output:** All APIs return pure JSON with correct headers
9. **Error Handling:** Unified error responses without exposing internals

## Sample Response - Patients List

```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "items": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "owner_id": 1,
                "patient_number": "P2412011234",
                "name": "Max",
                "species": "dog",
                "breed": "Labrador",
                "birth_date": "2020-03-15",
                "is_active": true,
                "owner_first_name": "John",
                "owner_last_name": "Doe",
                "owner_email": "john.doe@example.com"
            }
        ],
        "count": 1
    }
}
```

## Testing

Use the verification script to test all endpoints:
```bash
php verify_api.php
```

Or test individual endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost/api/patients.php?action=list
curl http://localhost/api/owners.php?action=list
curl http://localhost/api/integrity_json.php
```

## Notes

- All APIs maintain HTTP 200 status for better frontend compatibility
- CSRF protection is preserved where it was already implemented
- Database operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks
- Helper functions for generating unique numbers are centralized
- Response format is compatible with Alpine.js data binding
